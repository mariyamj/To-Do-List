# To-Do-List
I created a user-friendly to-do list application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It allows users to add, mark as done, and delete tasks. Tasks are saved in local storage, ensuring they persist across sessions. The app also displays the current date and time, providing a comprehensive and functional task management solution.
